## Key Takeaways (from my perspective)

- Hybrid work needs redesign and may be hiding the need for intentional redesign to avoid two-tiers.
- The world is reassing what work means and what options are availble. _Wish I'd discussed the great-resignation and the end of commutes._
- Using intentional team design to support remote and provided needed capabilities.
- Leadership styles need to catch up with the shift in working practices.
- More than ever, wellness is imoprtant. Leads must take _responsibily_ for providing the _right_ support for mental wellness.
