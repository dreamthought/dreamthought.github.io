title: QCon London (2013) - Climbing Out of a Crisis Loop: How a Critical BBC Back-end Team Reigned in a Workflow Crisis-to-crisis Cycle
---

## Summary

Raf Gemmail and Katherine Kirk tell the story of a BBC team which worked out of a severe crisis loop by bending the Agile 'rules' and combining multiple Agile and JFDI 'methods.'

Katherine and I paired on telling the story of how we took a team from a typical failing OOTB Scrum scenario to being a high-performing Kanban team. I discussed consciously focussing on Technical Debt. Amusingly,
Ward Cunningham approached me while I was eating lunch to give his kudos. I got to hear the Technical Debt stories first hand. An unforgettable moment.
