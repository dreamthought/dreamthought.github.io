# I'm a "Professor"

One thing my mother had always hoped was that I'd be a professor. Given that I'd chosen a professional path after graduating,
I never expected to be able to realise this wish of hers. Not until about 7 months after she'd passed, that is.

On returning to New Zealand I took on some work for OpenClassrooms.com and found myself working to a contracted title of Professor.
Rather than this being a gimic, the courses I have created with OC are path of a syallasbus which will provide students with actual
graduate and post-graduate qualifications. 

Openclassrooms is a French tech company which is disrupting academia.
They work with specialists from industry, government and traditional academic institutions in order to produce
French accredited bachelor and master qualifications awarded on completion of courses and projects inspired by 
real business scenarios which demand both engineering and specific tooling knowledge.

My role has been to partner with instructional designers, other industry specialists and members of the OC team 
in creating new courses, industry like projects, consulting on learning path-ways for architecture and 
helping shape non-ambiguous grading scales.

OC releases all of its courses under a Creative Commons licence.
Appreciative of our shared value alignment.
