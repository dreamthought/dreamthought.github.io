Hi, I'm Raf! 

I'm responsible for the thoughts and views here. I use these pages as an outlet for
minimally censored spewage about software, architecture, lean product development, learning loops, home-schooling, 
Science and the Ukulele. I am a dadgineer, proven technical leader, Agilista, architect and
full-stack polyglot engineer.

Check out my [resume](https://fiq.github.io/resume) if you want to collaborate, chat with or hire me.

I'm a Londoner, now living as a Kiwi in rural New Zealand. I work as the Head of Technology at a *remote-first* Scale-Up
which is redefining how we educate tomorrow's engineers. 

I've enjoyed 20 years of working on fun and performant projects at scale. Fun fact, I was developer **~\#4** at 
Booking.com* when it was a wee little pepper-shaker. Someone at a conference told me that I was their earliest commit 
(although this would have been in CVS). I built my first website in 1994 and believe in a free and open web.

I also report on engineering practices for [InfoQ.com](https://www.infoq.com/profile/Rafiq-Gemmail), a leading 
engineering news source. Checkout some of my news [here](https://www.infoq.com/profile/Rafiq-Gemmail).

Due to my love for building the right solution for the right business problem, I have naturally gravitated towards 
being a [comb-shaped](https://certibanks.com/KnowledgeArea.aspx?articleid=11) engineer.
